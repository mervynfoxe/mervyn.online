It's the first (hopefully only (but probably not)) snowstorm of the year! So of course that means I have to make Intelligent Fox Decisions and walk downtown for work instead of just staying home like a good little remote employee.

Really I just have an appointment at noon so I have to be out of the house anyway, and I figured I'd stop by for coffee in the morning before heading to the library to work and have my meeting<sup>*</sup>. But of course because there's over half a foot of snow and ice on the ground the buses are running on a delayed schedule, and I only found that out after waiting at the bus stop for 15 minutes, so I ended up making the 30 (45 in the snow) minute walk to the east end. And took a couple quick pics along the way!

<sup>*</sup>Of course, after going through all of this the library turned out to be closed due to the weather so, so much for all of this lmao.

![Selfie of me smiling and walking alongside a snowy sidewalk, with a lightly-covered street and power lines in the background. My hair is dusted with snow and I am wearing a tan winter jacket.](PXL_20250106_135024926.MP-1.jpg)

![Photo of a group of ice-encrusted bushes at a crosswalk. A large brick building is visible in the background, and snow covers the sidewalk around the bushes.](PXL_20250106_135447585-1.jpg)

![Photo of a snow-covered sidewalk lined with icy bushes. The road is plowed but still lightly snowy, and stretches on into the distance downtown.](PXL_20250106_140035116-1.jpg)

![Photo of a park entrance, with a sign reading "Thoroughbred Park" on a stone wall. A group of statues of running horses are to the right of the sign and coated in a layer of snow. The foreground is almost entirely untouched snow, and the background is lined with bare and icy trees.](PXL_20250106_140816774-1.jpg)

By the way, since I didn't post about it a few days ago, happy new year! I hope you all had a nice holiday and were able to reset a bit for the new year. <3

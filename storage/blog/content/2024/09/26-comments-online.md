Alright apparently the strat here is to just post about how I'll "maybe think about adding this feature eventually" because that means I'll just do it within the next day or two.

I gave in and went ahead and added a little comment widget to my posts here! Definitely needs testing in production but that's how I roll. I'm using a little service called [Cusdis](https://cusdis.com/), which is a privacy-focused comment widget alternative to Disqus, because I'm not about to ruin this site with a smidge of third-party tracking tools or anything.

Because it's an open, anyone-can-comment type system, all comments have to be manually reviewed/approved before they show up, so it may take a bit before they're visible since it's all down to my schedule and when I check the dashboard, but I'll try and be good about that.

I also added a [shoutbox](../../page/shoutbox) page not tied to any one post, because I still miss my old freewebs homepage and all the shouts I got there.
